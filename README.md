# Artificial Pancreas Case by ![Tegla Technologies][logo]
Set of CAD models to fit the electronic components of a closed loop system artificial pancreas.

Created by Caroline Dahl in collaboration with John Sj√∂lund.

## Materials and Settings
CAD model generated in Autodesk's Tinkercad and sliced in Cura 15.04.6 using default settings for High quailty print and brim.

Models were 3D-printed on an Ultimaker 2 using Innofil3D PLA filament, 3mm (2.85mm).
Standard PLA-settings were used: 210C print, 60C bed.
